## Bug description
<!--A clear and concise description of what the bug is.-->


<!--A good method to find and fix bugs is explained here https://adv-r.hadley.nz/debugging.html#debugging-strategy 
(it's written for R, but this section is generic for most computer languages)
-->
<!--We cannot do steps 1, 2 and 3 for you, the closer you get to a concise piece of code highlighting the bug
the less time we'll spenf understanding it, and fixing it. And the more robust will be the fix as we'll most likely
write unit test to make sure the bug does not reappear in the future. This is why we insist on having 
"A clear and concise description of what the bug is"-->


## How to reproduce
<!--Explain in detail how to reproduce your issue. The easier it will be for us to
reproduce it, the faster we will be able to work on this.-->

### Command line
<!--Ideally, if we execute the following command, the bug will directly be reproduced. 
Here put the command line we have to execute-->
```bash
# command line used if any 
```

### Code snippet
<!--Expose the python code you want us to test-->
```python
import grid2op

... # Some code 
```
