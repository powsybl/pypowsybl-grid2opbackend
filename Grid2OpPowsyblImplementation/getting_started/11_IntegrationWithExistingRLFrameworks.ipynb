    "## Organisation of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "For the organisation of this notebook we decided to first detail features closer to grid2op to go later on \"higher level\" feature that are closer to \"standard\" gym representation (eg `Box` and `Discrete` space).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the closer you are to grid2op the more grid2op feature you can use. For example, in gym environment, it is not possible to use the \"simulate\" function (remember, this function allow to use a simulator that has a behaviour close to the one of the environment) at all. Also, grid2op observation and action comes with a lot of different feature (capacity to add them, to retrieve the graph of the grid etc.) which is not possible to use directly in gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, this notebook is organized as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Convert it to a gym environment](#Convert-it-to-a-gym-environment): basic use of the `gym_compat` grid2op module allowing to convert a grid2op environment to a gym environment.\n",
    "- [Action space](#Action-space): basic usage of the action space, by removing redundant feature (`gym_env.observation_space.ignore_attr`) or transforming feature from a continuous space to a discrete space (`ContinuousToDiscreteConverter`)\n",
    "- [Observation space](#Observation-space): basic usage of the observation space, by removing redunddant features (`keep_only_attr`) or to scale the data on between a certain range (`ScalerAttrConverter`)\n",
    "- [Making the grid2op agent](#Making-the-grid2op-agent) explains how to make a grid2op agent once trained. Note that a more \"agent focused\" view is provided in the notebook [04_TrainingAnAgent](04_TrainingAnAgent.ipynb) !\n",
    "- [1) RLLIB](#1\\)-RLLIB): more advance usage for customizing the observation space (`gym_env.observation_space.reencode_space` and `gym_env.observation_space.add_key`) or modifying the type of gym attribute (`MultiToTupleConverter`) as well as an example of how to use RLLIB framework\n",
    "- [2)-Stable baselines](#2\\)-Stable-baselines): even more advanced usage for customizing the observation space by concatenating it to a single \"Box\" (instead of a dictionnary) thanks to `BoxGymObsSpace` and to use `BoxGymActSpace` if you are more focus on continuous actions and `MultiDiscreteActSpace` for discrete actions (**NB** in both case there will be loss of information as compared to regular grid2op actions! for example it will be harder to have a representation of the graph of the grid there)\n",
    "- [3) Tf Agents](#3\\)-Tf-Agents) explains how to convert the action space into a \"Discrete\" gym space thanks to `DiscreteActSpace`\n",
    "\n",
    "On each sections, we also explain concisely how to train the agent. Note that we did not spend any time on customizing the default agents and training scheme. It is then less than likely that these agents there"
