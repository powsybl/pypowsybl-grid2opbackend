class IdToAct(Converter):
    """
    This type of converter allows to represent action with unique id. Instead of manipulating complex objects, it allows
    to manipulate only positive integer.

    The list of all actions can either be the list of all possible unary actions (see below for a complete
    description) or by a given pre computed list.

    A "unary action" is an action that consists only in acting on one "concept" it includes:

    - disconnecting a single powerline
    - reconnecting a single powerline and connect it to bus xxx on its origin end and yyy on its extremity end
    - changing the topology of a single substation
    - performing redispatching on a single generator
    - performing curtailment on a single generator
    - performing action on a single storage unit

    Examples of non unary actions include:
    - disconnection / reconnection of 2 or more powerlines
    - change of the configuration of 2 or more substations
    - disconnection / reconnection of a single powerline and change of the configration of a single substation

    **NB** All the actions created automatically are unary. For the L2RPN 2019, agent could be allowed to act with non
    unary actions, for example by disconnecting a powerline and reconfiguring a substation. This class would not
    allow to do such action at one time step.

    **NB** The actions that are initialized by default uses the "set" way and not the "change" way (see the description
    of :class:`grid2op.BaseAction.BaseAction` for more information).

    For each powerline, 5 different actions will be computed:

    - disconnect it
    - reconnect it and connect it to bus 1 on "origin" end ann bus 1 on "extremity" end
    - reconnect it and connect it to bus 1 on "origin" end ann bus 2 on "extremity" end
    - reconnect it and connect it to bus 2 on "origin" end ann bus 1 on "extremity" end
    - reconnect it and connect it to bus 2 on "origin" end ann bus 2 on "extremity" end

    Actions corresponding to all topologies are also used by default. See
    :func:`grid2op.BaseAction.ActionSpace.get_all_unitary_topologies_set` for more information.

    In this converter:

    - `encoded_act` are positive integer, representing the index of the actions.
    - `transformed_obs` are regular observations.

    **NB** The number of actions in this converter can be especially big. For example, if a substation counts N elements
    there are roughly 2^(N-1) possible actions in this substation. This means if there are a single substation with
    more than N = 15 or 16 elements, the amount of actions (for this substation alone) will be higher than 16.000
    which makes it rather difficult to handle for most machine learning algorithm. Be carefull with that !

        This function is used to initialized the converter. When the converter is created, this method should be called

        Parameters
        ----------
        all_actions: ``None``, ``list``, ``str``, ``np.ndarray``
            See the example section for more informations.

            if `all_actions` is:

                - ``None``: the action space will be built from scratch using the provided key word arguments.
                - a ``list``: The (ordered) list of all actions that the agent will be able to perform.
                  If given a number ``i`` the
                  converter will return action ``all_actions[i]``. In the "pacman" game, this vector could be
                  ["up", "down", "left", "right"], in this case "up" would be encode by 0, "down" by 1, "left" by 2 and
                  "right" by 3. If nothing is provided, the converter will output all the unary actions possible for
                  the environment. Be careful, computing all these actions might take some time.
                - a ``str`` this will be considered as a path where a previous converter has been saved. You need to
                  provide the full path, including the filename and its extension. It gives something like:
                  "/path/where/it/is/saved/action_space_vect.npy"

        kwargs:
            other keyword arguments (all considered to be ``True`` by default) that can be:

            set_line_status: ``bool``
                Whether you want to include the set line status in your action
                (in case the original action space allows it)

            change_line_status: ``bool``
                Whether you want to include the "change line status" in your action space
                (in case the original action space allows it)

            change_line_status: ``bool``
                Whether you want to include the "change line status" in your action space
                (in case the original action space allows it)

            set_topo_vect: ``bool``
                Whether you want to include the "set_bus" in your action space
                (in case the original action space allows it)

            change_bus_vect: ``bool``
                Whether you want to include the "change_bus" in your action space
                (in case the original action space allows it)

            redispatch: ``bool``
                Whether you want to include the "redispatch" in your action space
                (in case the original action space allows it)

            curtail: ``bool``
                Whether you want to include the "curtailment" in your action space
                (in case the original action space allows it)

        Convert the action (compatible with this converter) into a "gym action" (ie an OrderedDict)

        This is not compatible with all converters and you need to install gym for it to work.

        Parameters
        ----------
        action:
            the action to be converted to an action compatible with the action space representation

        Returns
        -------
        res:
            The action converted to a "gym" model (can be used by a machine learning model)

        Examples
        ---------
        Here is an example on how to use this feature with the :class:`grid2op.Converter.IdToAct`
        converter (imports are not shown here).

        .. code-block:: python

            # create the environment
            env = grid2op.make()

            # create the converter

            # create the gym action space
            gym_action_space = GymObservationSpace(action_space=converter)

            converter_action = converter.sample()
            gym_action = converter.to_gym(converter_action)  # this represents the same action

        """
        from gym import spaces

        res = spaces.dict.OrderedDict({"action": int(action)})
