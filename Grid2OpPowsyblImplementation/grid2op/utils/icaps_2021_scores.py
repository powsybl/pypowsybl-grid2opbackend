class ScoreICAPS2021(ScoreL2RPN2020):
    """
    This class allows to compute the same score as the one computed for the ICAPS 2021 competitions.

    It uses some "EpisodeStatistics" of the environment to compute these scores. These statistics, if not available
    are computed at the initialization.

    When using it a second time these information are reused.


    This scores is the combination of the `ScoreL2RPN2020` score and some extra scores based on the alarm feature.

    Examples
    ---------
    This class can be used as follow:

    .. code-block:: python

        import grid2op
        from grid2op.utils import ScoreICAPS2021
        from grid2op.Agent import DoNothingAgent

        env = grid2op.make("l2rpn_case14_sandbox")
        nb_scenario = 2
        my_score = ScoreICAPS2021(env,
                                  nb_scenario=nb_scenario,
                                  env_seeds=[0 for _ in range(nb_scenario)],
                                  agent_seeds=[0 for _ in range(nb_scenario)]
                                  )

        my_agent = DoNothingAgent(env.action_space)
        print(my_score.get(my_agent))


    Notes
    -------
    To prevent overfitting, we strongly recommend you to use the :func:`grid2op.Environment.Environment.train_val_split`
    and use this function on the built validation set only.

    Also note than computing the statistics, and evaluating an agent on a whole dataset of multiple GB can take a
    really long time and a lot of memory. This fact, again, plea in favor of using this function only on
    a validation set.

    We also strongly recommend to set the seeds of your agent (agent_seeds)
    and of the environment (env_seeds) if you want to use this feature. Reproducibility is really important if you
    want to make progress.

    .. warning::

        The triggering (or not) of the recomputation of the statistics is not perfect for now.
        We recommend you to use always
        the same seeds (`env_seeds` and `agent_seeds` key word argument of this functions)
        and the same parameters (`env.parameters`) when using a given environments.

        You might need to clean it manually if you change
        one of theses things by calling :func:`ScoreL2RPN2020.clear_all()` function .
