class GridValue(RandomObject, ABC):
    """
    This is the base class for every kind of data for the _grid.

    It allows the :class:`grid2op.Environment` to perform powergrid modification that make the "game" time dependant.

    It is not recommended to directly create :class:`GridValue` object, but to use the
    :attr:`grid2op.Environment.chronics_handler" for such a purpose. This is made in an attempt to make sure the
    :func:`GridValue.initialize` is called. Before this initialization, it is not recommended to use any
    :class:`GridValue` object.

    The method :func:`GridValue.next_chronics` should be used between two epoch of the game. If there are no more
    data to be generated from this object, then :func:`GridValue.load_next` should raise a :class:`StopIteration`
    exception and a call to :func:`GridValue.done` should return True.

    In grid2op, the production and loads (and hazards or maintenance) can be stored in this type of
    of "GridValue". This class will map things generated (or read from a file) and assign the given element
    of the powergrid with its proper value at each time steps.

    Attributes
    ----------
    time_interval: :class:`.datetime.timedelta`
        Time interval between 2 consecutive timestamps. Default 5 minutes.

    start_datetime:  :class:`datetime.datetime`
        The datetime of the first timestamp of the scenario.

    current_datetime: :class:`datetime.datetime`
        The timestamp of the current scenario.

    max_iter: ``int``
        Number maximum of data to generate for one episode.

    curr_iter: ``int``
        Duration of the current episode.

    maintenance_time: ``numpy.ndarray``, dtype:``int``
        Number of time steps the next maintenance will take place with the following convention:

            - -1 no maintenance are planned for the forseeable future
            - 0 a maintenance is taking place
            - 1, 2, 3 ... a maintenance will take place in 1, 2, 3, ... time step

        Some examples are given in :func:`GridValue.maintenance_time_1d`.

    maintenance_duration: ``numpy.ndarray``, dtype:``int``
        Duration of the next maintenance. 0 means no maintenance is happening. If a maintenance is planned for a
        given powerline, this number decreases each time step, up until arriving at 0 when the maintenance is over. Note
        that if a maintenance is planned (see :attr:`GridValue.maintenance_time`) this number indicates how long
        the maintenance will last, and does not suppose anything on the maintenance taking place or not (= there can be
        positive number here without a powerline being removed from the grid for maintenance reason). Some examples are
        given in :func:`GridValue.maintenance_duration_1d`.

    hazard_duration: ``numpy.ndarray``, dtype:``int``
        Duration of the next hzard. 0 means no maintenance is happening. If a hazard is taking place for a
        given powerline, this number decreases each time step, up until arriving at 0 when the maintenance is over. On
        the contrary to :attr:`GridValue.maintenance_duration`, if a component of this vector is higher than 1, it
        means that the powerline is out of service. Some examples are
        given in :func:`GridValue.get_hazard_duration_1d`.

        This function is used to initialize the data generator.
        It can be use to load scenarios, or to initialize noise if scenarios are generated on the fly. It must also
        initialize :attr:`GridValue.maintenance_time`, :attr:`GridValue.maintenance_duration` and
        :attr:`GridValue.hazard_duration`.

        This function should also increment :attr:`GridValue.curr_iter` of 1 each time it is called.

        The :class:`GridValue` is what makes the connection between the data (generally in a shape of files on the
        hard drive) and the power grid. One of the main advantage of the Grid2Op package is its ability to change
        the tool that computes the load flows. Generally, such :class:`grid2op.Backend` expects data in a specific
        format that is given by the way their internal powergrid is represented, and in particular, the "same"
        objects can have different name and different position. To ensure that the same chronics would
        produce the same results on every backend (**ie** regardless of the order of which the Backend is expecting
        the data, the outcome of the powerflow is the same) we encourage the user to provide a file that maps the name
        of the object in the chronics to the name of the same object in the backend.

        This is done with the "names_chronics_to_backend" dictionnary that has the following keys:

          - "loads"
          - "prods"
          - "lines"

        The value associated to each of these keys is in turn a mapping dictionnary from the chronics to the backend.
        This means that each *keys* of these subdictionnary is a name of one column in the files, and each values
        is the corresponding name of this same object in the dictionnary. An example is provided bellow.

        Parameters
        ----------
        order_backend_loads: ``numpy.ndarray``, dtype:str
            Ordered name, in the Backend, of the loads. It is required that a :class:`grid2op.Backend` object always
            output the informations in the same order. This array gives the name of the loads following this order.
            See the documentation of :mod:`grid2op.Backend` for more information about this.

        order_backend_prods: ``numpy.ndarray``, dtype:str
            Same as order_backend_loads, but for generators.

        order_backend_lines: ``numpy.ndarray``, dtype:str
            Same as order_backend_loads, but for powerline.

        order_backend_subs: ``numpy.ndarray``, dtype:str
            Same as order_backend_loads, but for powerline.

        names_chronics_to_backend: ``dict``
            See in the description of the method for more information about its format.

        Examples
        --------
        For example, suppose we have a :class:`grid2op.Backend` with:

          - substations ids strart from 0 to N-1 (N being the number of substations in the powergrid)
          - loads named "load_i" with "i" the subtations to which it is connected
          - generators units named "gen_i" (i still the substation id to which it is connected)
          - powerlnes are named "i_j" if it connected substations i to substation j

        And on the other side, we have some files with the following conventions:

          - substations are numbered from 1 to N
          - loads are named "i_C" with i being the substation to which it is connected
          - generators are named "i_G" with is being the id of the substations to which it is connected
          - powerlines are namesd "i_j_k" where i is the origin substation, j the extremity substations and "k"
            is a unique identifier of this powerline in the powergrid.

        In this case, instead of renaming the powergrid (in the backend) of the data files, it is advised to build the
        following elements and initialize the object gridval of type :class:`GridValue` with:
