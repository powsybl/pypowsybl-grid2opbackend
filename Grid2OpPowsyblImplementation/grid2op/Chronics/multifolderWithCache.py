class MultifolderWithCache(Multifolder):
    """
    This class is a particular type of :class:`Multifolder` that, instead of reading is all from disk each time
    stores it into memory.

    For now it's only compatible (because it only present some kind of interest) with :class:`GridValue` class
    inheriting from :class:`GridStateFromFile`.

    The function :func:`MultifolderWithCache.reset` will redo the cache from scratch. You can filter which
    type of data will be cached or not with the :func:`MultifolderWithCache.set_filter` function.

    **NB** Efficient use of this class can dramatically increase the speed of the learning algorithm, especially at
    the beginning where lots of data are read from the hard drive and the agent games over after a few time steps (
    typically, data are given by months, so 30*288 >= 8600 time steps, while during exploration an agent usually
    performs less than a few dozen of steps leading to more time spent reading 8600 rows than computing the
    few dozen of steps.

    .. warning::
        When you create an environment with this chronics class (*eg* by doing 
        `env = make(...,chronics_class=MultifolderWithCache)`), the "cache" is not
        pre loaded, only the first scenario is loaded in memory (to save loading time).
        
        In order to load everything, you NEED to call `env.chronics_handler.reset()`, which,
        by default, will load every scenario into memory. If you want to filter some
        data, for example by reading only the scenario of decembre, you can use the 
        `set_filter` method.
        
        A typical workflow (at the start of your program) when using this class is then:
        
        1) create the environment: `env = make(...,chronics_class=MultifolderWithCache)`
        2) (optional but recommended) select some scenarios: 
           `env.chronics_handler.real_data.set_filter(lambda x: re.match(".*december.*", x) is not None)`
        3) load the data in memory: `env.chronics_handler.reset()`
        4) do whatever you want using `env`

    .. note::
        After creation (anywhere in your code), 
        you can use other scenarios by calling the `set_filter` function again:
        
        1) select other scenarios: 
           `env.chronics_handler.real_data.set_filter(lambda x: re.match(".*january.*", x) is not None)` 
        2) load the data in memory: `env.chronics_handler.reset()`
        3) do whatever you want using `env`
    
    Examples
    ---------
    This is how this class can be used:

    .. code-block:: python

        import re
        from grid2op import make
        from grid2op.Chronics import MultifolderWithCache
        env = make(...,chronics_class=MultifolderWithCache)

        # set the chronics to limit to one week of data (lower memory footprint)
        env.chronics_handler.set_max_iter(7*288)
        # assign a filter, use only chronics that have "december" in their name
        env.chronics_handler.real_data.set_filter(lambda x: re.match(".*december.*", x) is not None)
        # create the cache
        env.chronics_handler.reset()

        # and now you can use it as you would do any gym environment:
        my_agent = ...
        obs = env.reset()
        done = False
        reward = env.reward_range[0]
        while not done:
            act = my_agent.act(obs, reward, done)
            obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act)  # and step will NOT load any data from disk.
