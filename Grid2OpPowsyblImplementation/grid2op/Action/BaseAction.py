class BaseAction(GridObjects):
    """
    This is a base class for each :class:`BaseAction` objects.
    As stated above, an action represents conveniently the modifications that will affect a powergrid.

    It is not recommended to instantiate an action from scratch. The recommended way to get an action is either by
    modifying an existing one using the method :func:`BaseAction.update` or to call and :class:`ActionSpace` object that
    has been properly set up by an :class:`grid2op.Environment`.

    BaseAction can be fully converted to and back from a numpy array with a **fixed** size.

    An action can modify the grid in multiple ways.
    It can change :

    - the production and voltage setpoint of the generator units
    - the amount of power consumed (for both active and reactive part) for load
    - disconnect powerlines
    - change the topology of the _grid.

    To be valid, an action should be convertible to a tuple of 5 elements:

    - the first element is the "injections" vector: representing the way generator units and loads are modified

        - It is, in turn, a dictionary with the following keys (optional)

            - "load_p" a vector of the same size of the load, giving the modification of the loads active consumption
            - "load_q" a vector of the same size of the load, giving the modification of the loads reactive consumption
            - "prod_p" a vector of the same size of the generators, giving the modification of the productions active
              setpoint production
            - "prod_v" a vector of the same size of the generators, giving the modification of the productions voltage
              setpoint

    - the second element is made of force line status. It is made of a vector of size :attr:`BaseAction._n_lines`
      (the number of lines in the powergrid) and is interpreted as:

            - -1 force line disconnection
            - +1 force line reconnection
            - 0 do nothing to this line

    - the third element is the switch line status vector. It is made of a vector of size :attr:`BaseAction.n_line`
      and is
      interpreted as:

        - ``True``: change the line status
        - ``False``: don't do anything

    - the fourth element set the buses to which the object is connected. It's a vector of integers with the following
      interpretation:

        - 0 -> don't change
        - 1 -> connect to bus 1
        - 2 -> connect to bus 2
        - -1 -> disconnect the object.

    - the fifth element changes the buses to which the object is connected. It's a boolean vector interpreted as:

        - ``False``: nothing is done
        - ``True``: change the bus eg connect it to bus 1 if it was connected to bus 2 or connect it to bus 2 if it was
          connected to bus 1. NB this is only active if the system has only 2 buses per substation (that's the case for
          the L2RPN challenge).

    - the sixth element is a vector, representing the redispatching. Component of this vector is added to the
      generators active setpoint value (if set) of the first elements.

    **NB** the difference between :attr:`BaseAction._set_topo_vect` and :attr:`BaseAction._change_bus_vect` is the
    following:

        - If  a component of :attr:`BaseAction._set_topo_vect` is 1, then the object (load, generator or powerline)
          will be moved to bus 1 of the substation to which it is connected. If it is already to bus 1 nothing will be
          done.
          If it's on another bus it will connect it to bus 1. It's disconnected, it will reconnect it and connect it
          to bus 1.
        - If a component of :attr:`BaseAction._change_bus_vect` is True, then the object will be moved from one bus to
          another.
          If the object were on bus 1
          it will be moved on bus 2, and if it were on bus 2, it will be moved on bus 1. If the object were
          disconnected,
          then this does nothing.

    The conversion to the action into an understandable format by the backend is performed by the "update" method,
    that takes into account a dictionary and is responsible to convert it into this format.
    It is possible to overload this class as long as the overloaded :func:`BaseAction.__call__` operator returns the
    specified format, and the :func:`BaseAction.__init__` method has the same signature.

    This format is then digested by the backend and the powergrid is modified accordingly.

    Attributes
    ----------

    _set_line_status: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        For each powerline, it gives the effect of the action on the status of it. It should be understood as:

          - -1: disconnect the powerline
          - 0: don't affect the powerline
          - +1: reconnect the powerline

    _switch_line_status: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
        For each powerline, it informs whether the action will switch the status of a powerline of not. It should be
        understood as followed:

          - ``False``: the action doesn't affect the powerline
          - ``True``: the action affects the powerline. If it was connected, it will disconnect it. If it was
            disconnected, it will reconnect it.

    _dict_inj: ``dict``
        Represents the modification of the injection (productions and loads) of the power _grid. This dictionary can
        have the optional keys:

            - "load_p" to set the active load values (this is a numpy array with the same size as the number of load
              in the power _grid with Nan: don't change anything, else set the value
            - "load_q": same as above but for the load reactive values
            - "prod_p": same as above but for the generator active setpoint values. It has the size corresponding
              to the number of generators in the test case.
            - "prod_v": same as above but set the voltage setpoint of generator units.

    _set_topo_vect: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:int
        Similar to :attr:`BaseAction._set_line_status` but instead of affecting the status of powerlines, it affects the
        bus connectivity at a substation. It has the same size as the full topological vector
        (:attr:`BaseAction._dim_topo`)
        and for each element it should be understood as:

            - 0 -> don't change
            - 1 -> connect to bus 1
            - 2 -> connect to bus 2
            - -1 -> disconnect the object.

    _change_bus_vect: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
         Similar to :attr:`BaseAction._switch_line_status` but it affects the topology at substations instead of the
         status of
         the powerline. It has the same size as the full topological vector (:attr:`BaseAction._dim_topo`) and each
         component should mean:

             - ``False``: the object is not affected
             - ``True``: the object will be moved to another bus. If it was on bus 1 it will be moved on bus 2, and if
               it was on bus 2 it will be moved on bus 1.

    authorized_keys: :class:`set`
        The set indicating which keys the actions can understand when calling :func:`BaseAction.update`

    _subs_impacted: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
        This attributes is either not initialized (set to ``None``) or it tells, for each substation, if it is impacted
        by the action (in this case :attr:`BaseAction._subs_impacted`\[sub_id\] is ``True``) or not
        (in this case :attr:`BaseAction._subs_impacted`\[sub_id\] is ``False``)

    _lines_impacted: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:bool
        This attributes is either not initialized (set to ``None``) or it tells, for each powerline, if it is impacted
        by the action (in this case :attr:`BaseAction._lines_impacted`\[line_id\] is ``True``) or not
        (in this case :attr:`BaseAction._subs_impacted`\[line_id\] is ``False``)

    attr_list_vect: ``list``, static
        The authorized key that are processed by :func:`BaseAction.__call__` to modify the injections

    attr_list_vect_set: ``set``, static
        The authorized key that is processed by :func:`BaseAction.__call__` to modify the injections

    _redispatch: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        Amount of redispatching that this action will perform. Redispatching will increase the generator's active
        setpoint
        value. This will be added to the value of the generators. The Environment will make sure that every physical
        constraint is met. This means that the agent provides a setpoint, but there is no guarantee that the setpoint
        will be achievable. Redispatching action is cumulative, this means that if at a given timestep you ask +10 MW
        on a generator, and on another you ask +10 MW then the total setpoint for this generator that the environment
        will try to implement is +20MW.

    _storage_power: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        Amount of power you want each storage units to produce / absorbs. Storage units are in "loads"
        convention. This means that if you ask for a positive number, the storage unit will absorb
        power from the grid (=it will charge) and if you ask for a negative number, the storage unit
        will inject power on the grid (storage unit will discharge).

    _curtail: :class:`numpy.ndarray`, dtype:float
        For each renewable generator, allows you to give a maximum value (as ratio of Pmax, *eg* 0.5 =>
        you limit the production of this generator to 50% of its Pmax) to renewable generators.
        
        .. warning::
            In grid2op we decided that the "curtailment" type of actions consists in directly providing the 
            upper bound you the agent allowed for a given generator. It does not reflect the amount
            of MW that will be "curtailed" but will rather provide a limit on the number of
            MW a given generator can produce.

    Examples
    --------
    Here are example on how to use the action, for more information on what will be the effect of each,
    please refer to the explanatory notebooks.

    You have two main methods to build actions, as showed here:

    .. code-block:: python

        import grid2op
        env_name = ...
        env = grid2op.make(env_name)

        # first method:
        action_description = {...}  # see below
        act = env.action_space(action_description)

        # second method
        act = env.action_space()
        act.PROPERTY = MODIF

    The description of action as a dictionary is the "historical" method. The method using the properties
    has been added to simplify the API.

    To connect / disconnect powerline, using the "set" action, you can:

    .. code-block:: python

        # method 1
        act = env.action_space({"set_line_status": [(line_id, new_status), (line_id, new_status), ...]})

        # method 2
        act = env.action_space()
        act.line_set_status = [(line_id, new_status), (line_id, new_status), ...]

    typically: 0 <= line_id <= env.n_line and new_status = 1 or -1

    To connect / disconnect powerline using the "change" action type, you can:

    .. code-block:: python

        # method 1
        act = env.action_space({"change_line_status": [line_id, line_id, ...]})

        # method 2
        act = env.action_space()
        act.line_change_status = [line_id, line_id, ...]

    typically: 0 <= line_id <= env.n_line

    To modify the busbar at which an element is connected you can (if using set, to use "change" instead
    replace "set_bus" in the text below by "change_bus" **eg** `nv.action_space({"change_bus": ...})`
    or `act.load_change_bus = ...` ):

    .. code-block:: python

        # method 1
        act = env.action_space({"set_bus":
                                    {"lines_or_id": [(line_id, new_bus), (line_id, new_bus), ...],
                                     "lines_ex_id": [(line_id, new_bus), (line_id, new_bus), ...],
                                     "loads_id": [(load_id, new_bus), (load_id, new_bus), ...],
                                     "generators_id": [(gen_id, new_bus), (gen_id, new_bus), ...],
                                     "storages_id": [(storage_id, new_bus), (storage_id, new_bus), ...]
                                     }
                                })

        # method 2
        act = env.action_space()
        act.line_or_set_bus = [(line_id, new_bus), (line_id, new_bus), ...]
        act.line_ex_set_bus = [(line_id, new_bus), (line_id, new_bus), ...]
        act.load_set_bus =  [(load_id, new_bus), (load_id, new_bus), ...]
        act.gen_set_bus = [(gen_id, new_bus), (gen_id, new_bus), ...]
        act.storage_set_bus = [(storage_id, new_bus), (storage_id, new_bus), ...]

    Of course you can modify one type of object at a time (you don't have to specify all "lines_or_id",
    "lines_ex_id", "loads_id", "generators_id", "storages_id"

    You can also give the topologies you want at each substations with:

    .. code-block:: python

        # method 1
        act = env.action_space({"set_bus":{
                                "substations_id": [(sub_id, topo_sub), (sub_id, topo_sub), ...]
                                }})
        # method 2
        act = env.action_space()
        act.sub_set_bus = [(sub_id, topo_sub), (sub_id, topo_sub), ...]

    In the above typically 0 <= sub_id < env.n_sub and topo_sub is a vector having the right dimension (
    so if a substation has 4 elements, then topo_sub should have 4 elements)

    It has to be noted that `act.sub_set_bus` will return a 1d vector representing the topology
    of the grid as "set" by the action, with the convention, -1 => disconnect, 0 => don't change,
    1=> set to bus 1 and 2 => set object to bus 2.


    In order to perform redispatching you can do as follow:

    .. code-block:: python

        # method 1
        act = env.action_space({"redispatch": [(gen_id, amount), (gen_id, amount), ...]})
        # method 2
        act = env.action_space()
        act.redispatch = [(gen_id, amount), (gen_id, amount), ...]

    Typically 0<= gen_id < env.n_gen and `amount` is a floating point between gen_max_ramp_down and
    gen_min_ramp_down for the generator modified.

    In order to perform action on storage units, you can:

    .. code-block:: python

        # method 1
        act = env.action_space({"set_storage": [(storage_id, amount), (storage_id, amount), ...]})

        # method 2
        act = env.action_space()
        act.set_storage = [(storage_id, amount), (storage_id, amount), ...]

    Typically `0 <= storage_id < env.n_storage` and `amount` is a floating point between the maximum
    power and minimum power the storage unit can absorb / produce.

    Finally, in order to perform curtailment action on renewable generators, you can:

    .. code-block:: python

        # method 1
        act = env.action_space({"curtail": [(gen_id, amount), (gen_id, amount), ...]})

        # method 2
        act = env.action_space()
        act.curtail = [(gen_id, amount), (gen_id, amount), ...]

    Typically `0 <= gen_id < env.n_gen` and `amount` is a floating point between the 0. and 1.
    giving the limit of power you allow each renewable generator to produce (expressed in ratio of
    Pmax). For example if `gen_id=1` and `amount=0.7` it means you limit the production of
    generator 1 to 70% of its Pmax.

        This method returns an action as a dictionnary, that can be serialized using the "json" module.

        It can be used to store the action into a grid2op indepependant format (the default action serialization, for speed, writes actions to numpy array.
        The size of these arrays can change depending on grid2op versions, especially if some different types of actions are implemented).

        Once you have these dictionnary, you can use them to build back the action from the action space.

        Examples

        action will be ambiguous).

        For example, an action that try to assign something to busbar 3 will be ambiguous *per se*. An action
        that tries to dispatch a non dispatchable generator will be also ambiguous *per se*.

        However, an action that "switch" (change) the status (connected / disconnected) of a powerline can be
        ambiguous and it will not be detected here. This is because the ambiguity depends on the current state
        of the powerline:

        - if the powerline is disconnected, changing its status means reconnecting it. And we cannot reconnect a
          powerline without specifying on which bus.
        - on the contrary if the powerline is connected, changing its status means disconnecting it, which is
          always feasible.

        Test the equality of two actions.

        2 actions are said to be identical if they have the same impact on the powergrid. This is unrelated to their
        respective class. For example, if an Action is of class :class:`Action` and doesn't act on the injection, it
        can be equal to an Action of the derived class :class:`TopologyAction` (if the topological modifications are the
        same of course).

        This implies that the attributes :attr:`Action.authorized_keys` is not checked in this method.

        Note that if 2 actions don't act on the same powergrid, or on the same backend (eg number of loads, or
        generators are not the same in *self* and *other*, or they are not in the same order) then action will be
        declared as different.

        **Known issue** if two backends are different, but the description of the _grid are identical (ie all
        n_gen, n_load, n_line, sub_info, dim_topo, all vectors \*_to_subid, and \*_pos_topo_vect are
        identical) then this method will not detect the backend are different, and the action could be declared

        Gives information about the element being impacted by this action.
        **NB** The impacted elements can be used by :class:`grid2op.BaseRules` to determine whether or not an action
        is legal or not.
        **NB** The impacted are the elements that can potentially be impacted by the action. This does not mean they
        will be impacted. For examples:

        * If an action from an :class:`grid2op.BaseAgent` reconnect a powerline, but this powerline is being
          disconnected by a hazard at the same time step, then this action will not be implemented on the grid.

        However, it this powerline couldn't be reconnected for some reason (for example it was already out of order)
        the action will still be declared illegal, even if it has NOT impacted the powergrid.

        * If an action tries to disconnect a powerline already disconnected, it will "impact" this powergrid.
          This means that even if the action will do nothing, it disconnecting this powerline is against the rules,
          then the action will be illegal.
        * If an action tries to change the topology of a substation, but this substation is already at the target
          topology, the same mechanism applies. The action will "impact" the substation, even if, in the end, it
          consists of doing nothing.

        Any such "change" that would be illegal is declared as "illegal" regardless of the real impact of this action
        on the powergrid.

        This function prevent an action to act on a powerline status if
        through the "set_bus" and "change_bus" part if a cooldown applies (
        see :ref:`action_powerline_status` for cases where this can apply)
        
        For example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            import grid2op
            import numpy as np

            env = grid2op.make(env_name)

            obs = env.reset()

            # >>> info["exception"] : IllegalAction('Powerline with ids [42] have been modified illegally (cooldown)')

        This is because in the second action, the powerline 42 is assigned to bus 2, so it would be reconnected, 
        which is not possible due to the cooldown.
        
        The behaviour is (for all powerlines where a cooldown applies *ie* `obs.time_before_cooldown_sub > 0`):
        
          - if this line is disconnected and is assigned to a bus 1 or 2 at a substation for
            one of its end, then this part of the action is ignored (it has not effect: bus will NOT
            be set)
          - if this line is connected and it is assigned to bus "-1" at one of its side
            (extremity or origin side) then this part of the action is ignored (bus will NOT be "set")
          - if this line is disconnected and the bus to one of its side is "changed", then this
            part is ignored: bus will NOT be changed
        
        And regardless of cooldowns it also:
        
          - if a powerline is affected to a certain bus at one of its end with `set_bus` (for example 
            `set_bus` to 1 or 2) and at the same time disconnected (`set_line_status` is -1) then
            the `set_bus` part is ignore to avoid `AmbiguousAction`
          - if a powerline is disconnect from its bus at one of its end with `set_bus` (for example 
            `set_bus` to -1) and at the same time reconnected (`set_line_status` is 1) then
            the `set_bus` part is ignore to avoid `AmbiguousAction`
          - if a powerline is affected to a certain bus at one of its end with `change_bus` (`change_bus` is 
            ``True``) and at the same time disconnected (`set_line_status` is -1) then
            the `change_bus` part is ignore to avoid `AmbiguousAction`
            
            
        .. warning::
            This modifies the action in-place, especially the "set_bus" and "change_bus" attributes.
        
        .. note::
            This function does not check the cooldowns if you specify `check_cooldown=False`

        Preferably, if a key of the argument *dict_* is not found in :attr:`Action.authorized_keys` it should throw a

        requirement for all proper :class:`Action` subclass.

        Parameters
        ----------
        dict_: :class:`dict`
            If it's ``None`` or empty it does nothing. Otherwise, it can contain the following (optional) keys:

            - "*injection*" if the action will modify the injections (generator setpoint/load value - active or
              reactive) of the powergrid. It has optionally one of the following keys:

                    - "load_p": to set the active load values (this is a numpy array with the same size as the number of
                      load in the power _grid with Nan: don't change anything, else set the value
                    - "load_q": same as above but for the load reactive values
                    - "prod_p": same as above but for the generator active setpoint values. It has the size
                      corresponding to the number of generators in the test case.
                    - "prod_v": same as above but set the voltage setpoint of generator units.

            - "*hazards*": represents the hazards that the line might suffer (boolean vector) False: no hazard, nothing
              is done, True: a hazard, the powerline is disconnected
            - "*maintenance*": represents the maintenance operation performed on each powerline (boolean vector) False:
              no maintenance, nothing is done, True: a maintenance is scheduled, the powerline is disconnected
            - "*set_line_status*": a vector (int or float) to set the status of the powerline status (connected /
              disconnected) with the following interpretation:

                - 0: nothing is changed,
                - -1: disconnect the powerline,
                - +1: reconnect the powerline. If an action consists in "reconnecting" a powerline, and this same
                  powerline is affected by a maintenance or a hazard, it will be erased without any warning. "hazards"
                  and "maintenance" have the priority.

            - "change_line_status": a vector (bool) to change the status of the powerline. This vector should be
              interpreted as:

                - ``False``: do nothing
                - ``True``: change the status of the powerline: disconnect it if it was connected, connect it if it was
                  disconnected

            - "set_bus": (numpy int vector or dictionary) will set the buses to which the objects are connected. It
              follows a similar interpretation than the line status vector:

                - 0 -> don't change anything
                - +1 -> set to bus 1,
                - +2 -> set to bus 2, etc.
                - -1: You can use this method to disconnect an object by setting the value to -1.

            - "change_bus": (numpy bool vector or dictionary) will change the bus to which the object is connected.
              True will
              change it (eg switch it from bus 1 to bus 2 or from bus 2 to bus 1). NB this is only active if the system
              has only 2 buses per substation.

            - "redispatch": the best use of this is to specify either the numpy array of the redispatch vector you want
              to apply (that should have the size of the number of generators on the grid) or to specify a list of
              tuple, each tuple being 2 elements: first the generator ID, second the amount of redispatching,
              for example `[(1, -23), (12, +17)]`

            - "set_storage": the best use of this is to specify either the numpy array of the storage units vector
              you want
              to apply (that should have the size of the number of storage units on the grid) or to specify a list of
              tuple, each tuple being 2 elements: first the storage ID, second the amount of power you want to
              produce / absorb, for example `[(1, -23), (12, +17)]`

            **NB** the difference between "set_bus" and "change_bus" is the following:

              - If "set_bus" is 1, then the object (load, generator or powerline) will be moved to bus 1 of the
                substation to which it is connected. If it is already to bus 1 nothing will be done. If it's on another
                bus it will connect it to bus 1. It's disconnected, it will reconnect it and connect it to bus 1.
              - If "change_bus" is True, then objects will be moved from one bus to another. If the object were on bus 1
                then it will be moved on bus 2, and if it were on bus 2, it will be moved on bus 1. If the object is
                disconnected then the action is ambiguous, and calling it will throw an AmbiguousAction exception.

            **NB**: CHANGES: you can reconnect a powerline without specifying on each bus you reconnect it at both its
            ends. In that case the last known bus id for each its end is used.

            **NB**: if for a given powerline, both switch_line_status and set_line_status is set, the action will not
            be usable.
            This will lead to an :class:`grid2op.Exception.AmbiguousAction` exception.

            **NB**: The length of vectors provided here is NOT check in this function. This method can be "chained" and
            only on the final action, when used, eg. in the Backend, is checked.

            **NB**: If a powerline is disconnected, on maintenance, or suffer an outage, the associated "set_bus" will
            be ignored.
            Disconnection has the priority on anything. This priority is given because, in case of hazard, the hazard
            has the priority over the possible actions.

        Examples
        --------
        Here are short examples on how to update an action *eg.* how to create a valid :class:`Action` object that
        be used to modify a :class:`grid2op.Backend.Backend`.

        In all the following examples, we suppose that a valid grid2op environment is created, for example with:
        .. code-block:: python

            import grid2op
            # create a simple environment
            # and make sure every type of action can be used.
            env = grid2op.make(action_class=grid2op.Action.Action)

        *Example 1*: modify the load active values to set them all to 1. You can replace "load_p" by "load_q",
        "prod_p" or "prod_v" to change the load reactive value, the generator active setpoint or the generator
        voltage magnitude setpoint.

        .. code-block:: python

            new_load = np.ones(env.action_space.n_load)
            modify_load_active_value = env.action_space({"injection": {"load_p": new_load}})
            print(modify_load_active_value)

        *Example 2*: disconnect the powerline of id 1:

        .. code-block:: python

            disconnect_powerline = env.action_space({"set_line_status": [(1, -1)]})
            print(disconnect_powerline)
            # there is a shortcut to do that:
            disconnect_powerline2 = env.disconnect_powerline(line_id=1)

        *Example 3*: force the reconnection of the powerline of id 5 by connected it to bus 1 on its origin end and
        bus 2 on its extremity end.

        .. code-block:: python

            reconnect_powerline = env.action_space({"set_line_status": [(5, 1)],
                                                    "set_bus": {"lines_or_id": [(5, 1)]},
                                                    "set_bus": {"lines_ex_id": [(5, 2)]}
                                                     })
            print(reconnect_powerline)
            # and the shorter method:
            reconnect_powerline = env.action.space.reconnect_powerline(line_id=5, bus_or=1, bus_ex=2)

        *Example 4*: change the bus to which load 4 is connected:

        .. code-block:: python

        This method checks if an action is ambiguous or not. If the instance is ambiguous, an
        :class:`grid2op.Exceptions.AmbiguousAction` is raised.

        An action can be ambiguous in the following context:

          - It incorrectly affects the injections:

            - :code:`self._dict_inj["load_p"]` doesn't have the same size as the number of loads on the _grid.
            - :code:`self._dict_inj["load_q"]` doesn't have the same size as the number of loads on the _grid.
            - :code:`self._dict_inj["prod_p"]` doesn't have the same size as the number of loads on the _grid.
            - :code:`self._dict_inj["prod_v"]` doesn't have the same size as the number of loads on the _grid.

          - It affects the powerline in an incorrect manner:

            - :code:`self._switch_line_status` has not the same size as the number of powerlines
            - :code:`self._set_line_status` has not the same size as the number of powerlines
            - the status of some powerline is both *changed* (:code:`self._switch_line_status[i] == True` for some *i*)
              and *set* (:code:`self._set_line_status[i]` for the same *i* is not 0)
            - a powerline is both connected at one end (ex. its origin is set to bus 1) and disconnected at another
              (its extremity is set to bus -1)

          - It has an ambiguous behavior concerning the topology of some substations

            - the state of some bus for some element is both *changed* (:code:`self._change_bus_vect[i] = True` for
              some *i*) and *set* (:code:`self._set_topo_vect[i]` for the same *i* is not 0)
            - :code:`self._set_topo_vect` has not the same dimension as the number of elements on the powergrid
            - :code:`self._change_bus_vect` has not the same dimension as the number of elements on the powergrid

          - For redispatching, Ambiguous actions can come from:

            - Some redispatching action is active, yet
              :attr:`grid2op.Space.GridObjects.redispatching_unit_commitment_availble` is set to ``False``
            - the length of the redispatching vector :attr:`BaseAction._redispatching` is not compatible with the number
              of generators.
            - some redispatching are above the maximum ramp up :attr:`grid2op.Space.GridObjects.gen_max_ramp_up`
            - some redispatching are below the maximum ramp down :attr:`grid2op.Space.GridObjects.gen_max_ramp_down`
            - the redispatching action affect non dispatchable generators
            - the redispatching and the production setpoint, if added, are above pmax for at least a generator
            - the redispatching and the production setpoint, if added, are below pmin for at least a generator

        In case of need to overload this method, it is advise to still call this one from the base :class:`BaseAction`
        with ":code:`super()._check_for_ambiguity()`" or ":code:`BaseAction._check_for_ambiguity(self)`".

            Or any of its more precise subclasses, depending on which assumption is not met.

          * `prod_p`: if the action modifies the active productions of generators.
          * `prod_v`: if the action modifies the voltage setpoint of generators.

            is a dictionary with keys:

              * `nb_changed`: number of powerlines having their status changed
              * `changed_id`: the ids of the powerlines that are changed

          * `change_bus_vect`: if the action tries to **change** the topology of some substations. If present, this
            is a dictionary with keys:

              * `nb_modif_subs`: number of substations impacted by the action
              * `modif_subs_id`: ids of the substations impacted by the action
              * `change_bus_vect`: details the objects that are modified. It is itself a dictionary that represents for
                each impacted substations (keys) the modification of the objects connected to it.

          * `set_bus_vect`: if the action tries to **set** the topology of some substations. If present, this is a
            dictionary with keys:

              * `nb_modif_subs`: number of substations impacted by the action
              * `modif_subs_id`: the ids of the substations impacted by the action

                each impacted substations (keys) how the elements connected to it are impacted (their "new" bus)

          * `hazards` if the action is composed of some hazards. In this case, it's simply the index of the powerlines
            that are disconnected because of them.
          * `nb_hazards` the number of hazards the "action" implemented (eg number of powerlines disconnected because of
            hazards.
          * `maintenance` if the action is composed of some maintenance. In this case, it's simply the index of the
            powerlines that are affected by maintenance operation at this time step.
            that are disconnected because of them.
          * `nb_maintenance` the number of maintenance the "action" implemented eg the number of powerlines
            disconnected because of maintenance operations.
          * `redispatch` the redispatching action (if any). It gives, for each generator (all generator, not just the
            dispatchable one) the amount of power redispatched in this action.
          * `storage_power`: the setpoint for production / consumption for all storage units

        Shorthand to get the type of an action. The type of an action is among:

        - "injection": does this action modifies load or generator active values
        - "voltage": does this action modifies the generator voltage setpoint or the shunts
        - "topology": does this action modifies the topology of the grid (*ie* set or switch some buses)
        - "line": does this action modifies the line status
        - "redispatching" does this action modifies the redispatching
        - "storage" does this action impact the production / consumption of storage units
        - "curtailment" does this action impact the non renewable generators through curtailment

        Notes
        ------

        A single action can be of multiple types.

        The `do nothing` has no type at all (all flags are ``False``)

        If a line only set / change the status of a powerline then it does not count as a topological
        modification.

        res: :class:`dict`
            A dictionary with keys and value depending on which object needs to be inspected:

            - if a load is inspected, then the keys are:

                - "new_p" the new load active value (or NaN if it doesn't change),
                - "new_q" the new load reactive value (or Nan if nothing has changed from this point of view)
                - "set_bus" the new bus where the load will be moved (int: id of the bus, 0 no change, -1 disconnected)
                - "change_bus" whether or not this load will be moved from one bus to another (for example is an action
                  asked it to go from bus 1 to bus 2)

            - if a generator is inspected, then the keys are:

                - "new_p" the new generator active setpoint value (or NaN if it doesn't change),
                - "new_v" the new generator voltage setpoint value (or Nan if nothing has changed from this point of
                  view)
                - "set_bus" the new bus where the load will be moved (int: id of the bus, 0 no change, -1 disconnected)
                - "change_bus" whether or not this load will be moved from one bus to another (for example is an action
                  asked it to go from bus 1 to bus 2)
                - "redispatch" the amount of power redispatched for this generator.
                - "curtailment": the amount of curtailment on this generator

            - if a powerline is inspected then the keys are:

                - "change_bus_or": whether or not the origin end will be moved from one bus to another
                - "change_bus_ex": whether or not the extremity end will be moved from one bus to another
                - "set_bus_or": the new bus where the origin will be moved
                - "set_bus_ex": the new bus where the extremity will be moved
                - "set_line_status": the new status of the power line
                - "change_line_status": whether or not to switch the status of the powerline

            - if a substation is inspected, it returns the topology to this substation in a dictionary with keys:

                - "change_bus"
                - "set_bus"

            - if a storage unit is inspected, it returns a dictionary with:

                - "change_bus"
                - "set_bus"
                - "power" : the power you want to produce  / absorb with the storage unit ( if < 0 the power is
                  produced, if > 0 then power is absorbed)

        NB the difference between "set_bus" and "change_bus" is the following:

            - If "set_bus" is 1, then the object (load, generator or powerline) will be moved to bus 1 of the substation
              to which it is connected. If it is already to bus 1 nothing will be done. If it's on another bus it will
              connect it to bus 1. It's disconnected, it will reconnect it and connect it to bus 1.
            - If "change_bus" is True, then the object will be moved from one bus to another. If the object were on
              bus 1
              then it will be moved on bus 2, and if it were on bus 2, it will be moved on bus 1. If the object were
              disconnected, then it will be connected to the affected bus.

        Examples

        To retrieve the impact of the action on the storage unit, you can do:

            import grid2op

            act.gen_set_bus = [(1, 2), (0, -1)]

            # method 4: change the storage unit by their name with a dictionary
            act.gen_set_bus = {"gen_1_0": 2}

        .. note:: The "rule of thumb" to modify an object using "set" method it to provide always
            the ID of an object AND its value. The ID should be an integer (or a name in some cases)
            and the value an integer representing on which busbar to put the new element.

        Notes
        -----
        It is a "property", you don't have to use parenthesis to access it:

        .. code-block:: python

            # valid code
            gen_buses = act.gen_set_bus

            # invalid code, it will crash, do not run
            gen_buses = act.gen_set_bus()
            # end do not run

        And neither should you uses parenthesis to modify it:

        .. code-block:: python

            # valid code
            act.gen_set_bus = [(1, 2), (0, -1)]

            # invalid code, it will crash, do not run
            act.gen_set_bus([(1, 2), (0, -1)])
            # end do not run

        Property cannot be set "directly", you have to use the `act.XXX = ...` syntax. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # valid code
            act.gen_set_bus = [(1, 2), (0, -1)]

            # invalid code, it will raise an error, and even if it did not it would have not effect
            # do not run

              and if it was disconnected it will stay disconnected)

        Examples
        --------

        To retrieve the impact of the action on the storage unit, you can do:

        .. code-block:: python

            gen_buses = act.gen_change_bus

        To modify these buses you can do:

        .. code-block:: python

            # create an environment where i can modify everything
            import numpy as np
            import grid2op
            from grid2op.Action import CompleteAction
            env = grid2op.make("educ_case14_storage", test=True, action_class=CompleteAction)

            # create an action
            act = env.action_space()

            # method 1 : provide the full vector
            act.gen_change_bus = np.ones(act.n_gen, dtype=bool)

            # method 2: provide the index of the unit you want to modify
            act.gen_change_bus = 1

            # method 3: provide a list of the units you want to modify
            act.gen_change_bus = [1, 2]

            # method 4: change the storage unit by their name with a set
            act.gen_change_bus = {"gen_1_0"}

        .. note:: The "rule of thumb" to modify an object using "change" method it to provide always
            the ID of an object. The ID should be an integer (or a name in some cases). It does not
            make any sense to provide a "value" associated to an ID: either you change it, or not.

        Notes
        -----
        It is a "property", you don't have to use parenthesis to access it:

        .. code-block:: python

            # valid code
            gen_buses = act.gen_change_bus

            # invalid code, it will crash, do not run
            gen_buses = act.gen_change_bus()
            # end do not run

        And neither should you uses parenthesis to modify it:

        .. code-block:: python

            # valid code
            act.gen_change_bus = [1, 2, 3]

            # invalid code, it will crash, do not run
            act.gen_change_bus([1, 2, 3])
            # end do not run

        Property cannot be set "directly", you have to use the `act.XXX = ..` syntax. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # valid code
            act.gen_change_bus = [1, 3, 4]

            # invalid code, it will raise an error, and even if it did not it would have not effect
            # do not run
            act.gen_change_bus[1] = True
            # end do not run

        .. note:: Be careful not to mix "change" and "set". For "change" you only need to provide the ID of the elements
            you want to change, for "set" you need to provide the ID **AND** where you want to set them.

            A vector of integer, of size `act.n_gen` indicating what type of action is performed for
            each generator units. Note that these are the setpoint. The actual redispatching that will
            be available might be different. See :ref:`generator-mod-el` for more information.

        Examples
        --------

        To retrieve the impact of the action on the generator unit, you can do:

        .. code-block:: python

            redisp = act.redispatch

        For each generator it will give the amount of redispatch this action wants to perform.

        To change the setpoint of the redispatching, you can do:

        .. code-block:: python

            # create an environment where i can modify everything
            import numpy as np
            import grid2op
            from grid2op.Action import CompleteAction
            env = grid2op.make("educ_case14_storage", test=True, action_class=CompleteAction)

            # create an action
            act = env.action_space()

            # method 1 : provide the full vector
            act.redispatch = np.ones(act.n_gen, dtype=float)  # only floats are accepted !

            # method 2: provide the index of the unit you want to modify
            act.redispatch = (1, 2.5)

            # method 3: provide a list of the units you want to modify
            act.redispatch = [(1, 2.5), (0, -1.3)]

            # method 4: change the generators by their name with a dictionary
            act.redispatch = {"gen_1_0": 2.0}

        .. note:: The "rule of thumb" to perform redispatching is to provide always
            the ID of an object AND its value. The ID should be an integer (or a name in some cases)
            and the value a float representing what amount of redispatching you want to perform on the
            unit with the associated ID.

        Notes
        -----
        It is a "property", you don't have to use parenthesis to access it:

        .. code-block:: python

            # valid code
            redisp = act.redispatch

            # invalid code, it will crash, do not run
            redisp = act.redispatch()
            # end do not run

        And neither should you uses parenthesis to modify it:

        .. code-block:: python

            # valid code
            act.redispatch = [(1, 2.5), (0, -1.3)]

            # invalid code, it will crash, do not run
            act.redispatch([(1, 2.5), (0, -1.3)])
            # end do not run

        Property cannot be set "directly", you have to use the `act.XXX = ..` syntax. For example:

        .. code-block:: python

            # valid code
            act.redispatch = [(1, 2.5), (0, -1.3)]

            # invalid code, it will raise an error, and even if it did not it would have not effect
            # do not run
            act.redispatch[1] = 2.5
            # end do not run

        .. note:: Be careful not to mix action to set something on a bus bar (where the values are integer,
            like "set_bus" or "set_status")
            and continuous action (where the values are float, like "redispatch" or "storage_p")

            We remind that "curtailment" will limit the number of MW produce by renewable energy sources. The agent
            is asked to provide the limit it wants and not the amount of MW it wants the generator to be cut off.
            
            For example, if a generator with a Pmax of 100 produces 55MW and you ask to "curtail_mw = 15" for this generator,
            its production will be limited to 15 MW (then droping from 55MW to 15MW) so loosing 40MW (and not 15 !)

        This function tries to limit the possibility to end up
        with a "game over" because actions on curtailment or storage units (see the "Notes" section
        for more information).
        
        It will modify the action (unless `do_copy` is `True`) from a given observation `obs`.
        It limits the curtailment / storage unit to ensure that the
        amount of MW curtailed / taken to-from the storage units
        are within `-sum(obs.gen_margin_down)` and `sum(obs.gen_margin_up)`
        
        The `margin` parameter is here to allows to "take into account" the uncertainties. Indeed, if you 
        limit only to `-sum(obs.gen_margin_down)` and `sum(obs.gen_margin_up)`, because you don't know 
        how much the production will vary (due to loads, or intrisinc variability of
        renewable energy sources). The higher `margin` the less likely you will end up with 
        a "game over" but the more your action will possibly be affected. The lower
        this parameter, the more likely you will end up with a game over but the less
        your action will be impacted. It represents a certain amount of `MW`.
        
        Notes
        -------
        
        At each time, the environment ensures that the following equations are met:

        1) for each controlable generators $p^{(c)}_{min} <= p^{(c)}_t <= p^{(c)}_{max}$
        2) for each controlable generators $-ramp_{min}^{(c)} <= p^{(c)}_t - p^{(c)}_{t-1} <= ramp_{max}^{(c)}$
        3) at each step the sum of MW curtailed and the total contribution of storage units 
           is absorbed by the controlable generators so that the total amount of power injected 
           at this step does not change: 
           $\sum_{\text{all generators } g} p^{(g, scenario)}_t = \sum_{\text{controlable generators } c}  p^{(c)}_t + \sum_{\text{storage unit } s} p^{s}_t + \sum_{\text{renewable generator} r} p^{(r)}_t$
           where $p^{(g)}_t$ denotes the productions of generator $g$ in the input data "scenario" 
           (*ie* "in the current episode", "before any modification", "decided by the market / central authority").

        In the above equations, `\sum_{\text{storage unit } s} p^{s}_t` are controled by the action (thanks to the storage units)
        and `\sum_{\text{renewable generator} r} p^{(r)}_t` are controlled by the curtailment.
        
        `\sum_{\text{all generators } g} p^{(g, scenario)}_t` are input data from the environment (that cannot be modify).
        
        The exact value of each `p^{(c)}_t` (for each controlable generator) is computed by an internal routine of the
        environment. 
        
        The constraint comes from the fact that `\sum_{\text{controlable generators } c}  p^{(c)}_t` is determined by the last equation
        above but at the same time the values of each `p^{(c)}_t` (for each controllable generator) is heavily constrained
        by equations 1) and 2).

        .. note::
            This argument and the :func:`grid2op.Parameters.Parameters.LIMIT_INFEASIBLE_CURTAILMENT_STORAGE_ACTION` have the same objective:
            prevent an agent to do some curtailment too strong for the grid.
            
            When using  :func:`grid2op.Parameters.Parameters.LIMIT_INFEASIBLE_CURTAILMENT_STORAGE_ACTION`, 
            the environment will do it knowing exactly what will happen next (its a bit "cheating") and limit 
            exactly the action to exactly right amount.
            
            Using :func:`grid2op.Aciton.BaseAction.limit_curtail_storage` is always feasible, but less precise
            and subject to uncertainties.
        
        .. warning::
            If the action has no effect (for example you give a limit of the curtailment above the
            actual production of renewable generators) then regardless of the "margin" parameter
            your action will be declared "legal" which may cause unfeasibility in the future.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        obs : ``Observation``
            The current observation. The main attributes used for the observation are 
            `obs.gen_margin_down` and `obs.gen_margin_up`.
            
        margin : ``float``, optional
            The "margin" taken from the controlable generators "margin" to 
            "take into account" when limiting the action 
            (see description for more information), by default 10.
            
        do_copy : ``bool``, optional
            Whether to make a copy of the current action (if set to ``True``) or to modify the
            action "in-place" (default, when ``False``)
