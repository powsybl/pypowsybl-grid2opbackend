        It is a class internal to the :class:`grid2op.Environment.Environment` do not use outside
        of its purpose and do not attempt to modify it.

    This class aims at making the creation of rewards class more automatic by the :class:`grid2op.Environment`.

    It is not recommended to derived or modified this class. If a different reward need to be used, it is recommended
    to build another object of this class, and change the :attr:`RewardHelper.rewardClass` attribute.

    Attributes
    ----------
    rewardClass: ``type``
        Type of reward that will be use by this helper. Note that the type (and not an instance / object of that type)
        must be given here. It defaults to :class:`ConstantReward`

    template_reward: :class:`BaseReward`
        An object of class :attr:`RewardHelper.rewardClass` used to compute the rewards.
