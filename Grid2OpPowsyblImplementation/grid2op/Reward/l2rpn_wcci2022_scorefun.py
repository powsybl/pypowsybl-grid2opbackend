            It **must not** serve as a reward. This scored needs to be **MINIMIZED**,

            own risk.

    Implemented as a reward to make it easier to use in the context of the L2RPN competitions, this "reward"
    computed the "grid operation cost". It should not be used to train an agent.

    The "reward" the closest to this score is given by the :class:`RedispReward` class.
