class BaseReward(ABC):
    """
    Base class from which all rewards used in the Grid2Op framework should derived.

    In reinforcement learning, a reward is a signal send by the :class:`grid2op.Environment.Environment` to the
    :class:`grid2op.BaseAgent` indicating how well this agent performs.

    One of the goal of Reinforcement Learning is to maximize the (discounted) sum of (expected) rewards over time.


    You can create all rewards you want in grid2op. The only requirement is that all rewards should inherit this
    BaseReward.

    Attributes
    ----------
    reward_min: ``float``
        The minimum reward an :class:`grid2op.BaseAgent` can get performing the worst possible
        :class:`grid2op.Action.BaseAction` in
        the worst possible scenario.

    reward_max: ``float``
        The maximum reward an :class:`grid2op.Agent.BaseAgent` can get performing the best possible
        :class:`grid2op.Action.BaseAction` in
        the best possible scenario.

    Examples
    ---------
    If you want the environment to compute a reward that is the sum of the flow (this is not a good reward, but
    we use it as an example on how to do it) you can achieve it with:

    .. code-block:

        import grid2op
        from grid2op.Reward import BaseReward

        # first you create your reward
        class SumOfFlowReward(BaseReward):
            def __init__(self):
                BaseReward.__init__(self)

            def initialize(self, env):
                # this function is used to inform the class instance about the environment specification
                # you can use `env.n_line` or `env.n_load` or `env.get_thermal_limit()` for example
                # do not forget to initialize "reward_min" and "reward_max"
                self.reward_min = 0.
                self.reward_max = np.sum(env.get_thermal_limit)

                # in this case the maximum reward is obtained when i compute the sum of the maximum flows
                # on each powerline

            def __call__(action, env, has_error, is_done, is_illegal, is_ambiguous):
                # this method is called at the end of 'env.step' to compute the reward
                # in our case we just want to sum the flow on each powerline because... why not...
                if has_error:
                    # see the "Notes" paragraph for more information
                    res = self.reward_min
                else:
                    res = np.sum(env.get_obs().a_or)
                return res

        # then you create your environment with it:
        NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT = "rte_case14_realistic"
        env = grid2op.make(NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT,reward_class=SumOfFlowReward)
        # and do a step with a "do nothing" action
        obs = env.reset()
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(env.action_space())
        assert np.sum(obs.a_or) == reward
        # the above should be true

    Notes
    ------
    If the flag `has_error` is set to ``True`` this indicates there has been an error in the "env.step" function.
    This might induce some undefined behaviour if using some method of the environment.

    Please make sure to check whether or not this is the case when defining your reward.

    This "new" behaviour has been introduce to "fix" the akward behavior spotted in
    # https://github.com/rte-france/Grid2Op/issues/146

    .. code-block:: python

        def __call__(action, env, has_error, is_done, is_illegal, is_ambiguous):
            if has_error:
                # DO SOMETHING IN THIS CASE
                res = self.reward_min
            else:
                # DO NOT USE `env.get_obs()` (nor any method of the environment `env.XXX` if the flag `has_error`
                # is set to ``True``
                # This might result in undefined behaviour
                res = np.sum(env.get_obs().a_or)
            return res

        piece of code might not work as expected.

        Parameters

        Method called to compute the reward.

        Parameters
        ----------
        action: :class:`grid2op.Action.Action`
            BaseAction that has been submitted by the :class:`grid2op.BaseAgent`

        env: :class:`grid2op.Environment.Environment`
            An environment instance properly initialized.

        has_error: ``bool``
            Has there been an error, for example a :class:`grid2op.DivergingPowerFlow` be thrown when the action has
            been implemented in the environment.

        is_done: ``bool``
            Is the episode over (either because the agent has reached the end, or because there has been a game over)

        is_illegal: ``bool``
            Has the action submitted by the BaseAgent raised an :class:`grid2op.Exceptions.IllegalAction` exception.
            In this case it has been replaced by "do nohting" by the environment. **NB** an illegal action is NOT
            an ambiguous action. See the description of the Action module: :ref:`Illegal-vs-Ambiguous` for more details.

        is_ambiguous: ``bool``
            Has the action submitted by the BaseAgent raised an :class:`grid2op.Exceptions.AmbiguousAction` exception.
            In this case it has been replaced by "do nothing" by the environment. **NB** an illegal action is NOT
            an ambiguous action. See the description of the Action module: :ref:`Illegal-vs-Ambiguous` for more details.

        Returns
        -------
        res: ``float``
            The reward associated to the input parameters.

        Notes
        ------
        All the flags can be used to know on which type of situation the reward is computed.

        For example, if `has_error` is ``True`` it means there was an error during the computation of the powerflow.
        this means there is a "game_over", so ``is_done`` is ``True`` in this case.

        But, if there is ``is_done`` equal to ``True`` but ``has_error`` equal to ``False`` this means that the episode
        is over without any error. In other word, your agent sucessfully managed all the scenario and to get to the
        end of the episode.
