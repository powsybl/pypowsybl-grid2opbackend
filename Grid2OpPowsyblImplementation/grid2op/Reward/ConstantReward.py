    Most basic implementation of reward: everything has the same values: 0.0

    Note that this :class:`BaseReward` subtype is not useful at all, whether to train an :attr:`BaseAgent`
    nor to assess its performance of course.


    Examples
    ---------
    You can use this reward in any environment with:

    .. code-block:

        import grid2op
        from grid2op.Reward import ConstantReward

        # then you create your environment with it:
        NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT = "rte_case14_realistic"
        env = grid2op.make(NAME_OF_THE_ENVIRONMENT,reward_class=ConstantReward)
        # and do a step with a "do nothing" action
        obs = env.reset()
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(env.action_space())
        # the reward is 0., always... Not really useful
