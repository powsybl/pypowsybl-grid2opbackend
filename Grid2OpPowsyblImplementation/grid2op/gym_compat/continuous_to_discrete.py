class ContinuousToDiscreteConverter(BaseGymAttrConverter):
    """
    Some RL algorithms are particularly suited for dealing with discrete action space or observation space.

    This "AttributeConverter" is responsible to convert continuous space to discrete space. The way it does
    it is by using bins. It uses `np.linspace` to compute the bins.

    We recommend using an odd number of bins (eg 3, 7 or 9 for example).

    Examples
    --------
    If `nb_bins` is 3 and  the original input space is [-10, 10], then the split is the following:

    - 0 encodes all numbers in [-10, -3.33)
    - 1 encodes all numbers in  [-3.33, 3.33)
    - 2 encode all numbers in [3.33, 10.]

    And reciprocally, this action with :

    - 0 is understood as -5.0 (middle of the interval -10 / 0)
    - 1 is understood as 0.0 (middle of the interval represented by -10 / 10)
    - 2 is understood as 5.0 (middle of the interval represented by 0 / 10)

    If `nb_bins` is 5 and  the original input space is [-10, 10], then the split is the following:

    - 0 encodes all numbers in [-10, -6)
    - 1 encodes all numbers in  [-6, -2)
    - 2 encode all numbers in [-2, 2)
    - 3 encode all numbers in [2, 6)
    - 4 encode all numbers in [6, 10]

    And reciprocally, this action with :

    - 0 is understood as -6.6666...
    - 1 is understood as -3.333...
    - 2 is understood as 0.
    - 3 is understood as 3.333...
    - 4 is understood as 6.6666...

    TODO add example of code on how to use this.
