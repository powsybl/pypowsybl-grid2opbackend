        Generic function used to initialize the derived classes. For example, if an opponent reads from a file, the
        path where is the file is located should be pass with this method.

        Parameters
        ----------
        partial_env: grid2op Environment
            A pointer to the environment that initializes the opponent

        lines_attacked: ``list``
            The list of lines that the XPOpponent should be able to disconnect

        attack_every_xxx_hour: ``float``
            Provide the average duration between two attacks. Note that this should be greater
            than `average_attack_duration_hour` as, for now, an agent can only do one consecutive attack.
            You should provide it in "number of hours" and not in "number of steps"

            It is used to compute the `attack_hazard_rate`.
            Attacks time are sampled with a duration distribution. For this opponent, we use the simplest of these
            distributions : The geometric disribution
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution (the discrete time counterpart of the exponential
            distribution).
            The attack_hazard_rate is the main parameter of this distribution. It can be seen as the (constant)
            probability of having an attack
            in the next step. It is also the inverse of the expectation of the time to an attack.

        average_attack_duration_hour: ``float``
            Give, in number of hours, the average attack duration. This should be greater than
            `recovery_minimum_duration_hour`

            Used to compute the `recovery_rate`:
            Recovery times are random or at least should have a random part.
            In our case, we will say that the recovery time is equal to a fixed time (safety procedure time) plus a
            random time (investigations
            and repair operations) sampled according to a geometric distribution

        minimum_attack_duration_hour: ``int``
            Minimum duration of an attack (give it in hour)

        pmax_pmin_ratio: ``float``
            Ratio between the probability of the most likely line to be disconnected and the least likely one.
