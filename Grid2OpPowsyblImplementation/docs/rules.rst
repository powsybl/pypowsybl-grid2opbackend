Rules of the Game
===================================

This page is organized as follow:

.. contents:: Table of Contents
    :depth: 3

Objectives
-----------
The Rules module define what is "Legal" and what is not. For example, it can be usefull, at the beginning of the
training of an :class:`grid2op.Agent.BaseAgent` to loosen the rules in order to ease the learning process, and have
the agent focusing more on the physics. When the agent is performing well enough, it is then possible to make the
rules more and more complex up to the target complexity.

Rules includes:

- checking the number of powerline that can be connected / disconnected at a given time step
- checking the number of substations for which the topology can be reconfigured at a given timestep

If an action "break the rules" it is replaced by a do nothing. Note that the Rules of the game is different
from the concept of Ambiguous Action.

Behaviour
----------
In this section, we detail the behaviour of the "cooldown" on the line and substation to make sure  it's clear in the documentation.

The general rules is pretty simple:

1) if `obs.time_before_cooldown_line[l_id] > 0` for a given line id `l_id`, any attempt to modify
   the status of the powerline `l_id` will be illegal.
2) if `obs.time_before_cooldown_line[l_id] == 0` for a given line id `l_id`, it is possible
   to modify the status of powerline `l_id` without any issue. And at the next step, you will 
   need to wait for `env.parameters.NB_TIMESTEP_COOLDOWN_LINE` steps before being able to 
   modify the status of the powerline `l_id`
3) if `obs.time_before_cooldown_sub[s_id] > 0` for a given substation id `s_id`, any attempt to modify
   the topology of the substation `s_id` will be illegal.
4) if `obs.time_before_cooldown_sub[s_id] == 0` for a given substation id `s_id`, it is possible
   to modify the topology of substation `s_id` without any issue. And at the next step, you will 
   need to wait for `env.parameters.NB_TIMESTEP_COOLDOWN_SUB` steps before being able to 
   modify the topology of the substation `s_id`

To illustrate this, let's create an environment that we'll use for an example and force the cooldowns:

.. code-block:: python

    import grid2op
    env_name = "l2rpn_case14_sandbox"
    env = grid2op.make(env_name)
    env.set_id(0) 
    env.seed(0)

    # for this example, we enforce that we need to wait 3 steps
    # before being able to change again a line or a substation
    param = env.parameters
    param.NB_TIMESTEP_COOLDOWN_SUB = 3
    param.NB_TIMESTEP_COOLDOWN_LINE = 3
    env.change_parameters(param)

    obs = env.reset()

    # in summary (see descriptions bellow for more information) : 
    act_line_1 = env.action_space({"set_line_status": [(1, -1)]})
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_line_1)  # legal, obs.time_before_cooldown_line[1] = 3
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_line_1)  # illegal, obs.time_before_cooldown_line[1] = 2
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_line_1)  # illegal, obs.time_before_cooldown_line[1] = 1
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_line_1)  # illegal, obs.time_before_cooldown_line[1] = 0
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_line_1)  # legal, obs.time_before_cooldown_line[1] = 3

.. _rules-sub-cooldown:

Cooldown on substation
***********************

The general rule is:

1) if `obs.time_before_cooldown_sub[s_id] > 0` for a given substation id `s_id`, any attempt to modify
   the topology of the substation `s_id` will be illegal.
2) if `obs.time_before_cooldown_sub[s_id] == 0` for a given substation id `s_id`, it is possible
   to modify the topology of substation `s_id` without any issue. And at the next step, you will 
   need to wait for `env.parameters.NB_TIMESTEP_COOLDOWN_SUB` steps before being able to 
   modify the topology of the substation `s_id`

Now let's illustrate this with an action on substation 1:

.. code-block:: python

    obs = env.reset()

    # let's do an action
    act_sub1 = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(1, [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1])]}})
    # and see what happens
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_sub1)

Now, you can see that:

.. code-block:: python

    obs.time_before_cooldown_sub
    # >>> array([0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)

This is because in the parameters we specified `param.NB_TIMESTEP_COOLDOWN_SUB = 3` and that we 
acted on substaiton 1. In this case, the substation 1 `obs.time_before_cooldown_sub[1]` is 3.

And as long as `obs.time_before_cooldown_sub[1] > 0` you will not be able to act on this
substation again, whether you do the same action or another.

.. code-block:: python

    # let's do another action
    act_sub1_ = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(1, [1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1])]}})
    # and see what happens
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_sub1_)
    info['is_illegal']
    # >>> True  => the action is illegal
    info["exception"]
    # >>> [Grid2OpException IllegalAction IllegalAction('Substation with ids [1] have been modified illegally (cooldown)')]
    # the exception raised explains why

    # at this stage we have to wait still 2 steps before doing an action
    obs.time_before_cooldown_sub
    # >>> array([0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)

You can do an action on another substation without any issue:

.. code-block:: python

    # we can do an action on another substation if we want to
    act_sub2 = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(8, [2, 2, 1, 1, 1])]}})
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_sub2)
    info['is_illegal']
    # >>> False  => the action is perfectly legal
    info["exception"]
    # >>> []
    obs.time_before_cooldown_sub
    # >>> array([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)

At this stage you still cannot do an action on substation 1:

.. code-block:: python

    # we can do an action on another substation if we want to
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_sub1)
    info['is_illegal']
    # >>> True  => the action is illegal
    info["exception"]
    # >>> [Grid2OpException IllegalAction IllegalAction('Substation with ids [1] have been modified illegally (cooldown)')]
    # the exception raised explains why

    obs.time_before_cooldown_sub
    # >>> array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)

And now you can (after 3 steps, and "because" `obs.time_before_cooldown_sub[1] == 0`)
you can do an action on the substation 1, as shown bellow:

.. code-block:: python

    # we can do an action on another substation if we want to
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_sub1_)
    info['is_illegal']
    # >>> False  => the action is perfectly legal, you have waited 3 steps before being able to do an action on sub 1 again
    info["exception"]
    # >>> []

    obs.time_before_cooldown_sub
    # >>> array([0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)

Cooldown on powerlines
***********************

Actions on powerline status behaves exactly the same way as actions on substation:

1) if `obs.time_before_cooldown_line[l_id] > 0` for a given line id `l_id`, any attempt to modify
   the status of the powerline `l_id` will be illegal.
2) if `obs.time_before_cooldown_line[l_id] == 0` for a given line id `l_id`, it is possible
   to modify the status of powerline `l_id` without any issue. And at the next step, you will 
   need to wait for `env.parameters.NB_TIMESTEP_COOLDOWN_LINE` steps before being able to 
   modify the status of the powerline `l_id`

We invite you to read the paragraph on the substation :ref:`rules-sub-cooldown` for more information.

Corner cases
***********************

There are some "corner cases":

1) you can change, at any step a powerline and a line status (for the general rules)
2) You can modify the status of powerline by modifying the topology, see :ref:`action_powerline_status` 
   for such examples. The cooldown are applied with respect to the type of the action decided by grid2op, and
   not the way the action are given.

Substation and powerline status
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With the default rules, you can change both a powerline status and a substation at the same step.
For example, you can change topology of substation 1 AND disconnect powerline 10, as shown bellow:

.. code-block:: python

    obs = env.reset()

    # let's do an action
    act = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(1, [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1])]},
                            "set_line_status": [(10, -1)]}
                          )
    # and see what happens
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act)

    info['is_illegal']
    # >>> False  => the action is perfectly legal, you have waited 3 steps before being able 
    #               to do an action on sub 1 or line 9 again
    info["exception"]
    # >>> []

    obs.time_before_cooldown_sub
    # >>> array([0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)
    obs.time_before_cooldown_line
    # >>> array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)


Actions can have "side effect"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We explained in section :ref:`action_powerline_status` of the documentation that you can perform action
on powerlines by specifying topology, for example:

.. code-block:: python

    obs = env.reset()

    # let's do an action
    act = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(1, [1, 2, 2, -1, 1, 1])]}}
                          )
    # and see what happens
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act)

    info['is_illegal']
    # >>> False  => the action is perfectly legal, you have waited 3 steps before being able 
    #               to do an action on sub 1 or line 4 again
    info["exception"]
    # >>> []

    obs.time_before_cooldown_sub
    # >>> array([0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)
    obs.time_before_cooldown_line
    # >>> array([0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)

This action disconnects powerline 4 AND change the action of substation 1 at the same time 
(this is because one of the side of line 4 is connected to substation 1, and it's the `-1` provided in the example). Now let's
try to do an action on substation 4 (the other side of line 4 is connected at this substation):

.. code-block:: python
    
    # let's do an action
    act_sub4 = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(4, [2, 2, 2, 1, 1] )]}})

    # and see what happens
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_sub4)

    info['is_illegal']
    # >>> True  
    info["exception"]
    # >>> [Grid2OpException IllegalAction IllegalAction('Powerline with ids [4] have been modified illegally (cooldown)')]

    obs.time_before_cooldown_sub
    # >>> array([0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)
    obs.time_before_cooldown_line
    # >>> array([0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)

This action is illegal. In fact, if it were made on the grid, powerline 4 would be connected, but the rules prevent
its reconnection: there is a cooldown on powerline 4 (you still have to wait 3 steps before reconnecting it).

There are multiple ways to overcome this issue:

- modify the action "a posteriori" to "leave powerline 4 disconnected" (post processing)
- know which elements not to modify, and leave it "alone" (pre processing)

For example, we show how to modify the code to assign `0` (meaning "I don't change" in grid2op framework)
to the lines that are already disconnected (so the lines such that `obs.line_status` is `False`)

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    obs = env.reset()
    act = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(1, [1, 2, 2, -1, 1, 1])]}})
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act)

    act_sub4_clean = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(4, [2, 2, 2, 1, 1])]}})
    ## post processing
    act_sub4_clean.remove_line_status_from_topo()  # grid2op >= 1.8.0
    # act_sub4_clean.line_or_set_bus = [(l_id, 0) for l_id in np.arange(obs.n_line) if not obs.line_status[l_id]]
    # act_sub4_clean.line_ex_set_bus = [(l_id, 0) for l_id in np.arange(obs.n_line) if not obs.line_status[l_id]]
    ## continue as usual
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act_sub4_clean)

    info['is_illegal']
    # >>> False  
    info["exception"]
    # >>> []

    obs.time_before_cooldown_sub
    # >>> array([0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)
    obs.time_before_cooldown_line
    # >>> array([0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], dtype=int32)

And as you can see, the action could be effectively made on the grid. Powerline 4 is not reconnected, 
the cooldown decreased for powerline 4 and substation 1, 

Alternatively, you could have specified your action like: 
`act_sub4_clean = env.action_space({"set_bus": {"substations_id": [(4, [2, 0, 2, 1, 1])]}})`
(which is basically what the code above did) but it requires some manipulation to know that the
end side of powerline 4 is on substation 4 (`obs.line_ex_to_subid[4] == 4`), and then that this 
element is the second component of this substation (`obs.line_ex_to_sub_pos[4] == 1`). We do 
not recommend using this method.

.. note::
    As for grid2op 1.8.0 we added the function `act.remove_line_status_from_topo(obs)` that does this job
